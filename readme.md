## Console Calculator 
Console calculator application written fully in Go Lang. <br>
This here application helped me get stronger with the concept of functions and return statements in go as well as using the switch statement in Go lang. <br>
This project equally taught me how to recieve user input in Go lang (I didn't see this in the w3schools tutorial).
